## Introduction

This repo contains the files needed for getting macOS working on a **Huawei MateBook X Pro (2020 Edition)** laptop with OpenCore.
* This is intended to create a "fully" functional (as far as possible) hackintosh for the Huawei Matebook X Pro.
* The project can be considered **stable**.
* With each new release of macOS we need to resolve each new "minor issue" we run into. 
* If you would like to get started with creating a hackintosh on your MBXP but have non experience, I would highly recommend following [**Dortania's OpenCore Install guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and then returning here for troubleshooting or last improvements.


### Summary

- The **compatibility** is **very good** for the most part, most of the stuff works like it would on a real MacBook, including camera, audio, touchpad, iCloud services.
- The **experience** is **pleasant**, as the laptop is smooth and responsive under macOS Big Sur/Catalina.
- **Battery life** is **quite great** (from personal experience it **lasts from 4-6 hours** for light works depending on its age with a behaviour very similar to Windows 11.

(With the use of turbo boost disabled)
http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com/

- The **Intel WiFi** card is soldered onto the motherboard, which means it can't be replaced with a Broadcom one, but the Intel card is now **functional albeit not operating at full speeds** (however it is fine for most use cases).
    * With the latest `AirportItlwm.kext` even **Handoff** and **Continuity** features are working, but with a very limited support for AirDrop and Apple Watch unlocking (see [Changelog for OpenIntelWireless release](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)).
    * For any issues about `AirportItlwm.kext` please refer first to [**OpenIntelWireless Troubleshooting page**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/Troubleshooting.html#kernel-extension-loading-status) and then to [**OpenIntelWireless Gitter Page**](https://gitter.im/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)


### Generate your own SMBIOS Information

For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. You need to generate your unique `SMBIOS` info by yourself (recommend to use [**CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)), and inject them into your `config.plist`.
- With every **EFI update** you retrieve from [here](https://github.com/RepoWeaver/MateBook-X-Pro-2020-Opencore/releases), please, remember to transfer **your Device details** under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` in your `config.plist`.

- [x] Disable Secure Boot, Disable TPM, Thunderbolt (If you want to)

<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

1. **Intel Bluetooth** could not support some Bluetooth devices
2. **Touchscreen support is disabled by default** (Battery improvement)

#### Fixing Internal Speakers (taken from gnodipac886):

By default macOS only uses 2 out of your 4 speakers which sound muffled and are missing a lot of the high frequencies.

Enable surround sound to get a way better audio experience.

- Open Audio MIDI Setup from applications
- Click on the "+" symbol on the bottom left corner
- Click "Create Muti-Output Device"
- Check both of the Built-in Output options
- Select the newly created device in the menu bar
- Enjoy your music!

## Disabling CFG Lock and enabling DVMT 64 (BIOS patches):

There is the possibility of disabling CFG Lock and enabling dvmt 64. Disabling CFG Lock allows a better power management improvement. Enabling DVMT 64 allows 4K resolution in external screen. Both procedures (Customizing BIOS) are quite easy to follow, but you have to do very carefully and could brick your MBXP if you don't follow them step by step. Use them at your own risk!

(look at [this link](https://github.com/ske1996/Matebook-x-pro-2019-Hackintosh-newest/blob/main/readme-en.md#after-installation): "How to disable CFG Lock" and "Change dvmt to 64 mb" in "After installation" section).

These guides work without issue on the MateBook X Pro 2020 (tested with BIOS 1.19 and 1.21 versions). 

Each guide shows the changes to do in config.plist as well.
